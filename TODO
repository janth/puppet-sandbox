In no particular priority or order:

* VagrantConf/manifest/nodes/basenode.pp
   Do NOT install puppet on solaris, only gives 'ERROR: rpm not found'...
   Likewise, drop other linux spesific stuff
   => convert to proper classes

* Fix sol11 box
   FIXED: New guest/os type: solaris11, defined in plugins/guests/solaris11
   Need to fork+pull https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant
   => need to rename janth/vagrant to something appropriate... puppet_sandbox?

* BLUG session?



Not very likely (ie fun stuff, but ...):

* Fix vagrant logging

* Fix vagrant url + box timestamp check (to detect updated box-urls...)

* Test other vagrant providers
   AWS: https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant-aws
   KVM: https://github.com/adrahon/vagrant-kvm
   LXC: https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc

* write vagrant solariszone provider
